= Builtin guards =

So far, we have only used channels to `read()` and `write()` from/to
and pass to `Alt` objects. Other objects can be used in these ways
too, and in CSP these sorts of objects are all called _guards_. The
modules `csp.guards` and `csp.builtins` contain a number of basic
guards and processes which can be used as building blocks for larger
programs. These are largely based on a similar library in JCSP called
"plugNplay" and can be useful for quickly bootstraping programs. 

It is best to import the modules and look through their documentation,
but this tutorial page covers a few of the more useful or unusual
builtins with some examples.


== Timer ==

Guard which only commits to synchronisation when a timer has
expired. A `Timer` can also be used to _sleep_ a process without
importing the Python `time` module. For example:

{{{
from csp.builtins import Timer
from csp.csp import *

@process
def foobar():
    timer = Timer()
    print '1, 2, 3, 4, ...'
    timer.sleep(2) # 2 seconds.
    print '5'
}}}


To use a timer to execute code after a specified amount of time you
need to set it's `alarm` to trigger after a number of seconds and then
pass the timer to an `Alt`. The `Alt` will be able to select the timer
when it's alarm has triggered, like this:

{{{
from csp.builtins import Timer
from csp.csp import *

@process
def foobar():
    timer = Timer()
    alt = Alt(timer)
    timer.set_alarm(5)
    alt.select() # Wait 5 seconds here.
    print '5 seconds is up!'
}}}


== Skip ==

Guard which will always return `True`. Useful in `Alt`s where the
programmer wants to ensure that `Alt.select` will always synchronise
with at least one guard.

== Documentation for (some) builtins ==


== Skip ==

As well as being a guard, Skip can be used as a process which does
nothing. Think of it as the CSP equivalent of `None`:

{{{
>>> Skip().start()
>>> 
}}}


=== Blackhole ===
Read values from `cin` and do nothing with them.

    
=== Clock ===
Send `None` object down output channel every `resolution` seconds.
    

=== Generate ===

Generate successive (+ve) `int`s and write to `cout`. There is a
similar process with the signature `GenerateFloats(outchan,
epsilon=0.1)` which generates `float`s rather than `int`s. The
argument `epsilon` says how far apart each floating point number
should be. So the call `GenerateFloats(outchan, epsilon=0.1)' will
write the numbers 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... down the channel `outchan`. 
    
    
=== Mux2 ===

Mux2 provides a fair multiplex between two input channels.

=== Printer ===

Print all values read from `cin` to standard out or `out`.
    
=== Zeroes ===

Writes out a stream of zeroes.
